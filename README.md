## Project Overview: Wallet Application

The Wallet Application is a full-stack financial platform that simulates real-world banking operations, enabling users to manage accounts, process transactions, and track financial activity in real-time. Built with a modular, scalable architecture, the project features a robust and secure user experience, real-time updates, and seamless integration with a simulated banking system.

## Key Features

1. **SignUp/SignIn**: Secure user authentication for account creation and login.
2. **Automatic Sign-Up on Netbanking**: Users are automatically registered with the simulated Netbanking app, creating a seamless onboarding experience.
3. **Session-based Login with NextAuth**: Provides secure session management to maintain persistent user sessions.
4. **OnRamp/OffRamp Transactions**: Users can simulate adding or withdrawing funds between their wallet and a netbanking service.
5. **Peer-to-Peer Transfers**: Users can transfer funds between one another securely and instantly.
6. **Transaction History**: View comprehensive records of all OnRamp and OffRamp transactions in the app.
7. **Real-Time Transaction Status Updates**: Powered by a WebSocket server, users receive instant updates on transaction statuses, ensuring a transparent and responsive experience.

## Design Patterns and Architectures

- **Module Pattern**: Applied across the project to expose specific methods and variables, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Managed with **Turbo Repo**, enabling seamless handling of multiple services, dependencies, and builds in a single codebase.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Utilized for managing database instances efficiently, ensuring that only one instance is used across the app.
- **WebSocket PUB/SUB Pattern**: Implemented for real-time communication across services, ensuring users get live transaction updates.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Used in the frontend (React) to maintain clean, modular, and reusable UI components.

## Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

Using **GitHub Actions**, I have implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the build and deployment process:

1. **Pull Request Builds**: Triggers automatic builds on pull requests to ensure code stability.
2. **Main Branch Pushes**: Automatically pushes Docker images to the registry and deploys them to AWS EC2 using Docker Compose.
3. **Automated Docker Deployments**: Upon every push to the main branch, a new Docker image is generated, pulled, and deployed on the EC2 server for seamless updates.
